On startup, the program should broadcast its status on the local network (over UDP).
Then, the program should start accepting incoming local connections over TCP.
Finally, it should begin listening for UDP broadcasts by other clients and responding to them by requesting TCP connections with them.
At this point, the program has either found existing users or will find users when they start their clients.
Now, allow the user to enter text and transmit it to all connected clients, as well as display recieved messages.
